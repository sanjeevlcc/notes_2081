              +----------------+----------------+------------------+------------------------+--------------------------+
              | CustomerID     | Name           | Address          | Orders1                |  Order 2                 |
              +----------------+----------------+------------------+------------------------+--------------------------+

              +----------------+----------------+------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------+



Sushil Bhandari – 


		Topic: Understanding Functional Dependencies


		Example:
		
			Scenario: In an e-commerce system, a table contains order details.
			
			Table:
			OrderID	CustomerID	CustomerName	ProductID	ProductName
			1001	1	Alice	P101	Laptop
			1002	1	Alice	P102	Mouse
			1003	2	Bob	P101	Laptop
			
			
			FD:
			OrderID → CustomerID, CustomerName, ProductID, ProductName
			CustomerID → CustomerName
		
		
		Why Important: Helps identify unnecessary redundancy.
		


Tejendra Dharikar – 

		Importance of Normalization
		
		Example: Consider a table storing information about employees, 
		their departments, and project assignments.
		
		Before Normalization (Non-normalized table):
		
		EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Project
		101	John	HR	Payroll
		102	Mike	IT	System
		101	John	HR	System
		103	Sarah	IT	Payroll
		
		This table contains redundancy. Normalization helps 
		avoid this and reduces storage.
