		Scenario Overview
			Imagine you are managing the database of a large e-commerce platform.
			The platform stores critical customer data, transaction logs, product 
			information, and inventory records. Due to the high volume of transactions, 
			the system is susceptible to various types of failures. Your team needs 
			to implement a robust backup and recovery system to ensure the 
			availability, consistency, and integrity of the data in case of failures
			like system crashes, hardware malfunctions, or software bugs.
		
		
		Topics / Questions on Backup and Recovery
		
			Topic: Classifying failures and their impact on the database
			Case: Your e-commerce platform experiences a sudden hardware failure.
			The system crashes, causing incomplete transactions and potential data loss.

 E-commerce Website Database System
		
		
		Scenario Overview
			An e-commerce company has recently decided to implement 
			a new database management system (DBMS) to handle various aspects 
			of their online store, including product catalog, customer information,
			inventory management, and order processing. The company is moving
			from a basic file-based system to a DBMS to better manage their 
			growing data, enhance customer experience, and streamline internal processes.
			
			The main goal is to provide better product search capabilities, faster 
			order processing, and reliable customer support, all while ensuring
			data consistency and security.
		
		
		Questions
			How would a DBMS help the company manage large volumes of customer 
			data, transactions, and product information more effectively than
			a traditional file system?
			
			Given that the company’s e-commerce platform needs to scale and 
			provide web access for thousands of customers, which architecture (one-tier,
			two-tier, or n-tier) would be most suitable for their DBMS, and why?
			
			How would a Database Manager (DBM) ensure that only authorized 
			personnel can access sensitive customer data (e.g., payment details, 
			addresses) while allowing employees to perform necessary tasks like 
			updating product availability?

			Hospital Management System Database
			
			Scenario Overview
				A hospital is implementing a database management system (DBMS) to 
				streamline and automate its operations, which include managing patient 
				records, doctor appointments, medical inventory, billing, and staff
				management. The hospital needs a centralized system to track patient 
				history, doctors' schedules, medical supplies, and financial 
				transactions securely. This move aims to improve efficiency, 
				reduce human error, and ensure data privacy.
			
			
			
			
			Questions 
				How have database systems evolved to cater to complex healthcare management
				needs? Provide examples of similar applications in the healthcare industry.
				
				Given the hospital's need for a scalable system that can be accessed by 
				multiple branches and departments (e.g., emergency, outpatient, billing),
				which application architecture (one-tier, two-tier, or n-tier) would be 
				most appropriate, and why?
				
				How does data independence in a hospital management system allow for 
				future updates to patient records or medical history fields without 
				disrupting ongoing operations?
				
				Who are the key users of the hospital management database (e.g., medical
				staff, billing department, IT staff), and what kind of roles and permissions 
				would the Database Manager need to assign to each group?

		Online Banking System
		
		Scenario Overview
			You are managing the database system for an online banking platform. 
			The system supports multiple users who can perform transactions 
			simultaneously, such as transferring money between accounts, checking
			balances, and updating personal details. To ensure the integrity and 
			consistency of the data, it’s important to control concurrency and
			handle transactions effectively, especially when multiple users
			perform operations at the same time.
		
		Questions 
			What are the ACID properties of a transaction, and how do they contribute 
			to ensuring the integrity of banking data?
			
			
			Can you give an example of a situation where two concurrent transactions
			might violate serializability in an online banking system?
			
			
			How do locks (shared and exclusive) help maintain consistency when
			multiple users access bank accounts simultaneously?
			
			
			What are the differences between shared locks and exclusive locks 
			in the context of a banking system’s transaction management?

		Case Scenario: Library Management System
		
		Scenario Overview
			You are tasked with optimizing the database of a library
			management system. The system allows users to search for
			books, check availability, borrow, and return books. Librarians
			manage book inventories, track borrowed books, and issue fines
			for overdue items. Efficient query processing is crucial for 
			providing timely responses to users, especially when dealing
			with large volumes of book and transaction data.
		
		Questions 
		
			What are the challenges associated with processing multiple 
			queries simultaneously in a library system, especially during peak hours?
			
			How does the system determine which query plan to choose when multiple 
			queries request similar information (e.g., searching for books within 
			the same category)?
			
			What approach would you take to optimize queries that calculate overdue
			fines for users who have borrowed multiple books from various genres?
			
			How does query optimization improve response time during peak usage, such as
			when many users are searching for books simultaneously?

 E-commerce Website Database System
		
		
		Scenario Overview
			An e-commerce company has recently decided to implement 
			a new database management system (DBMS) to handle various aspects 
			of their online store, including product catalog, customer information,
			inventory management, and order processing. The company is moving
			from a basic file-based system to a DBMS to better manage their 
			growing data, enhance customer experience, and streamline internal processes.
			
			The main goal is to provide better product search capabilities, faster 
			order processing, and reliable customer support, all while ensuring
			data consistency and security.
		
		
		Questions
			How would a DBMS help the company manage large volumes of customer 
			data, transactions, and product information more effectively than
			a traditional file system?
			
			Given that the company’s e-commerce platform needs to scale and 
			provide web access for thousands of customers, which architecture (one-tier,
			two-tier, or n-tier) would be most suitable for their DBMS, and why?
			
			How would a Database Manager (DBM) ensure that only authorized 
			personnel can access sensitive customer data (e.g., payment details, 
			addresses) while allowing employees to perform necessary tasks like 
			updating product availability?

		Topic: Understanding Functional Dependencies


		Example:
		
			Scenario: In an e-commerce system, a table contains order details.
			
			Table:
			OrderID	CustomerID	CustomerName	ProductID	ProductName
			1001	1	Alice	P101	Laptop
			1002	1	Alice	P102	Mouse
			1003	2	Bob	P101	Laptop
			
			
			FD:
			OrderID → CustomerID, CustomerName, ProductID, ProductName
			CustomerID → CustomerName
		
		
		Why Important: Helps identify unnecessary redundancy.

		Importance of Normalization
		
		Example: Consider a table storing information about employees, 
		their departments, and project assignments.
		
		Before Normalization (Non-normalized table):
		
		EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Project
		101	John	HR	Payroll
		102	Mike	IT	System
		101	John	HR	System
		103	Sarah	IT	Payroll
		
		This table contains redundancy. Normalization helps 
		avoid this and reduces storage.
