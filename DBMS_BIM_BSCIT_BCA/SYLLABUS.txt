Course Objective
-----------------------
    The main objective of this course is to introduce 
    different concepts of database management
    system from theoretical and practical aspects.


Course Description
-----------------------
      The course covers different concepts of database
      management systems including database
      system concepts and architecture, ER diagram, 
      relational model, relational Calculus, SQL,
      normalization, transaction processing, concurrency 
      control, and database recovery. This
      course also covers some advanced concepts of 
      databases such as performance tuning,
      security, parallel and distributed database, 
      data warehousing, data mining and bigdata.
