Q)
Consider the following schema:
 Suppliers (# sid : integer, sname : string, address : string)
 Parts (# pid : integer, pname : string, color : string)
 Catalog (# sid : integer, # pid : integer, cost : real)
 
The key fields are underlined # and domain of each field is listed after the field
 name


1) Find the name of suppliers who supply some red parts
We first find the pids of parts that are red in color and then we compute the
natural join of this with catalog from this we project sid which gives ids of the
supplier who supply some red part, then we take the natural join of this with
supplier and project names which gives us the names of suppliers who supply
some red part
Step 1 : R1 = πpid(σcolor = ‘red’parts)
Step 2 : R2 = πsid(R1 $ Catalog )
Step 3 : R3 =πname(R2 $ Sppliers)

Required answer is R3



2) Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red or green parts

Step1: R1 = πpid(σcolor = ‘red’ V ‘green’parts)
Step 2 : R2 = πsid(R1 $ Catalog)

Same as above one but here we have to choose red or green parts and we have
to have sids of suppliers so we can stop after step 2 after choosing parts either
in red color or green color





3) Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red part or are at 221 packer Ave
Sids of suppliers who supply some red part
Step 1 : R1 = πpid(σcolor = ‘red’parts)
Step 2 : R2 = πsid(R1 $ Catalog )
Sids of suppiers who are at 221 packer Ave
Step 1 : R3 = πsidσaddress = ‘221 packer Ave(Suppliers)
Therefore sids of suppliers who supply some red part or are at 221 packer Ave
Is R2 U R3








4) Find the sids of suppliers who supply some red part and some green part
A) R1 = πsid(πpid(σcolor = ‘red’ parts) $ Catalog)
 R2 = πsid(πpid(σcolor = ‘green’parts) $ Catalog)
 From question one we get the sids of suppliers who supply some red part (R1)
 Similarly R2 is the sids of suppliers who supply some green part
 Required list of sids who supply some red and some green part is R1
 Intersection R2












5) Find the sids of suppliers who supply every part
A) R1=πsid,pid Catalog
 R2=πpidParts
 R1/R2 give us the required list of sids of suppliers who supply every part






6)Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red part
A)This is same as previous one but in R2 we consider only red parts
 R1= πsid,pid Catalog
 R2=πpidσcolr=’red’parts
 So required answer is R1/R2




7)Find the sids of suppliers who supply every red or green part
A) R1= πsid,pid Catalog
 R2=πpidσcolr=’red’ v ’green’ parts
 R1/R2 gives the sids of suppliers who supply every part which is either red in
 Color or green in color
