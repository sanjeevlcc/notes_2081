Let $\\beta_1$ be the parameter corresponding to the first feature and $\\beta_2$ be the parameter corresponding to the second feature. If we calculate the gradients with respect to $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$, we find that the gradient associated with $\\beta_1$ will be much smaller than the gradient associated with $\\beta_2$. If you remember, there was a similar scenario in the previous notebook where the gradient with respect to the parameter corresponding to the feature 'TV' was much larger than the gradient with respect to the parameter corresponding to the feature 'radio'.\n","When you update the weights using these gradients, the weights will be updated very unevenly. This results in slow convergence of Gradient Descent. \n","So to speed up the convergence, we scale the features to a similar range. The other reason for scaling the features to a similar range is to prevent the features with larger values dominate the ones with smaller values.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dNMtm28FD7zw"},"source":["The step size in the gradient descent actually depends on two factors: the learning rate and the gradient. If the gradient is large, we cannot use a large learning rate. You saw this in the previous notebook where the gradients were so large that we had to use a learning rate of $0.0000003$. So while scaling the features, we scale them to have **small** values of similar range. This results in smaller gradients which allows us to use a larger learning rate.
