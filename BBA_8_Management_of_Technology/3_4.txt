Sources of Technology:
============================
Technology can be acquired in different ways. 
It can be internally developed by R&D or discovery, it can be 
obtained by buying or otherwise acquiring an innovation resulting
from R&D or discovery, during various stages of the innovation 
process, or after the technology has
been largely perfected and approaches maturity.

Methods of technology acquisition are quite diverse and include 
purchase, transfer, and licensing, which in turn may involve 
acquisition of knowledge, process, product, or right to use of the technology.

Technology acquisition is complex because it combines 
efforts of protection of the rights of the owner and those of the
acquirer.

Changing Context of Technological Environment
===============================================

            The technological environment is dynamic and constantly 
            evolving due to several factors.
            
            Social and technological environments impact business decision-making. 
            These are the 'S' and 'T' elements of the PESTLE analysis . 
            
            The social environment includes factors like lifestyle and consumer trends. 
            
            The technological environment includes factors like artificial intelligence 
            and machine learning. 
            
            These external factors all have the ability to influence
            business strategy and objectives. Let's take a look
