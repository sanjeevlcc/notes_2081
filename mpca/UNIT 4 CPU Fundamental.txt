CPU Organization/Structure
------------------------------
Definition: CPU (Central Processing Unit) organization refers to the arrangement
of the major functional units and their interconnections within a CPU.

Key Components:
--------------------
      Control Unit (CU): Directs the operation of the processor.
      Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
      Registers: Small, fast storage locations.
      Cache: Fast memory close to the CPU.
      Buses: Channels for data transfer (data bus, address bus, control bus)

Design Principles for Modern Systems
--------------------------------------
    Scalability: 
    -----------------
        Design systems to scale in performance with
        increased workload or additional hardware.
    
    
    Efficiency: 
    -----------------
        Focus on power efficiency and performance per watt.
    
    
    Parallelism: 
    -----------------
        Utilize parallel processing techniques 
        such as multi-core processors and SIMD instructions.
    
    
    Memory Hierarchy: 
    -----------------
        Implement a hierarchy (registers, cache, RAM, secondary storage)
        for speed and efficiency.
    
    
    Modularity: 
    -----------------
        Design with modularity for easy upgrades and maintenance.
    
    
    Pipelining: 
    -----------------
        Increase instruction throughput by overlapping execution stages.
    
    
    
    Out-of-Order Execution: 
    -----------------
        Optimize CPU resource use by executing instructions
        as resources become available.
    
    
    
    Branch Prediction: 
    -----------------
      Use advanced techniques to minimize control hazards.
    
    
    Speculative Execution:
    -----------------
        Execute instructions before their necessity 
        is certain to reduce idle cycles.
    
    
    Reliability and Fault Tolerance:
    -----------------
        Design systems that detect, correct, and recover from faults.
