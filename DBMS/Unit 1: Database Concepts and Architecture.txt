Database
=======================================================

    A database is a systematic collection of data that is organized 
    so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. 
    
    Databases are used to store large amounts of information in a 
    way that supports efficient retrieval and manipulation. 
    
    Examples include customer databases, product inventories, and transactional records.



    Key Characteristics of a Database:
    -----------------------------------
      Structured: Data is organized in tables, rows, and columns.

      Persistent: Data remains stored permanently until explicitly deleted.

      Consistent: Maintains data integrity and accuracy.

      Accessible: Data can be efficiently retrieved and manipulated.

=======================================================
Database Management System (DBMS)
=======================================================

    A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed
    to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. 
    
    The DBMS serves as an interface between the end-users and the database,
    ensuring that data is consistently organized and easily accessible.

    --------------------------

        Data Definition: 
        -------------------
        Allows the creation, modification, and removal of 
        database structures (tables, indexes, etc.).


        Data Manipulation: 
        -------------------
        Supports querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
        
        
        Data Security:
        -------------------
        Enforces data access controls to ensure data 
        ecurity and privacy.
        
        Data Integrity:
        -------------------
        Maintains data accuracy and consistency.
    
        Data Backup and Recovery: 
        -----------------------
        Provides mechanisms to back up data and recover it 
        in case of loss or corruption.
        
        Concurrency Control: 
        -------------------
        Manages simultaneous data access to ensure transaction integrity.

Tier Architecture

DBMS in Real-Time Systems: 1-Tier, 2-Tier, and 3-Tier Architectures
=======================================================


1-Tier Architecture
---------------------
            In a 1-tier architecture, the database and the application 
            reside on the same system. 
            
            The user interacts directly with the database.
            
            Personal Desktop Applications

                  +---------------------+
                  | User Application    |
                  | (DBMS & Application)|
                  |    (Same System)    |
                  +---------------------+


2-Tier Architecture
            In a 2-tier architecture, the application (client) 
            communicates directly with the database system (server). 
            The user interface is on the client side, while the 
            database resides on the server side.

            Client-Server Applications:


            +---------------------+       +---------------------+
            |      Client         |       |       Server        |
            |  (User Interface)   | <-->  |      Database       |
            +---------------------+       +---------------------+





3-Tier Architecture
            In a 3-tier architecture, the system is divided into three layers: 
            presentation, application (logic), and data. 
            
            The client interacts with the application server, 
            which then communicates with the database server.
            
            Web-Based Applications
            
            +---------------------+       +---------------------+       +---------------------+
            |      Client         |       |  Application Server |       |     Database        |
            | (Presentation Layer)| <-->  | (Logic Layer)       | <-->  |     (Data Layer)    |
            +---------------------+       +---------------------+       +---------------------+

            in a centralized location, ensuring consistency across the organization.
            
            
            Data Integrity: 
            --------------------
            Databases enforce data integrity constraints to 
            ensure that the data remains accurate and valid.
            
            
            Data Security: 
            --------------------
            Advanced security features help protect sensitive
            data from unauthorized access and breaches.
            
            
            Data Sharing: 
            --------------------
            Multiple users and applications can share data 
            simultaneously, improving collaboration and efficiency.
            
            
            Data Independence: 
            --------------------
            The separation of data and application logic allows
            changes to be made to the database without affecting the applications that use it.
            
            
            Efficient Data Access: 
            --------------------
            Databases use structured query languages (SQL) to 
            retrieve and manipulate data quickly and efficiently.
            
            
            Backup and Recovery:
            --------------------
            Built-in mechanisms for backup and
            recovery ensure data can be restored in case of loss or corruption.

Data Models
=======================================================

A data model is a conceptual framework for organizing and 
structuring data within a database.
It defines how data is connected, stored, and accessed, 
providing a blueprint for database design and implementation.


      Types of Data Models:
      ------------------------
            Hierarchical Data Model: 
            --------------------
            Organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships. 
            It is simple but inflexible, as each child can have only one parent.

            Company
              |
              +--- Department 1
              |        |
              |        +--- Employee 1
              |        |
              |        +--- Employee 2
              |
              +--- Department 2
              |        |
              |        +--- Employee 3
              |        |
              |        +--- Employee 4
              |
              +--- Department 3
                       |
                       +--- Employee 5
                       |
                       +--- Employee 6





            
            Network Data Model: 
            --------------------
            Allows more complex relationships by organizing data in a 
            graph structure, where entities can have multiple parent and child nodes.

            
                      Project A
                      /   |    \
                     /    |     \
                    /     |      \
            Employee 1 - Task 1 - Employee 2
                |         |         |
                |         |         |
            Task 2 - Employee 3 - Task 3



            
            Relational Data Model: 
            -----------------------
            Represents data in tables (relations) with rows and columns. 
            It uses keys to establish relationships between tables and is
            the most widely used model due to its simplicity and flexibility.

=======================================================
Schemas and Instances 
=======================================================

Schemas
---------
      A schema is the structure that defines the organization
      of data within a database. 
      
      It describes how data is stored, including the tables, fields, 
      relationships, indexes, and constraints. 
      Schemas are essentially blueprints for the database.



      Types of Schemas:
      ----------------
            Physical Schema: 
            ----------------
            Describes how data is stored at the physical level, including files, 
            indexes, and physical storage structures.
            
            Logical Schema: 
            ----------------
            Describes the logical structure of the database, including tables,
            columns, data types, and relationships.
            
           : 
            ----------------
            Describes how specific users view the data, often including
            subsets of data from the logical schema for security or convenience.



Instance
---------
      An instance is the actual data stored in a 
      database at a particular moment in time. 
      While the schema defines the structure, the instance
      is the collection of data that conforms to that structure at any given point.

Three-Schema
=======================================================

The three-schema architecture is a framework for database
systems that separates the database system into three levels:

      Internal Schema (Physical Level):
      ------------------------------------
            Describes how data is physically stored and accessed.
            Includes storage structures, file organizations, and indexing techniques.



      Conceptual Schema (Logical Level):
      ------------------------------------
            Describes the structure of the entire database for a community of users.
            Includes entities, relationships, data types, constraints, and user operations.


      External Schema (View Level):
      ---------------------------
            Describes various user views of the database.
            Includes a subset of the database tailored to specific user needs or applications.

=======================================================
Architecture and Data Independence
=======================================================

Data independence refers to the ability to change the 
schema at one level of the database system without 
affecting the schema at the next higher level. 

      There are two types:
      ---------------------
            Logical Data Independence:
            --------------------------
            The capacity to change the conceptual schema without 
            affecting the external schemas or application programs.
            For example, adding a new field to a table should not affect user views.
            
            
            Physical Data Independence:
            --------------------------
            The capacity to change the internal schema without
            affecting the conceptual schema.
            For example, changing the way data is stored (e.g., using a 
            different indexing method) should not affect the logical structure.

      | |                             |  |   relies on the data.    | |
