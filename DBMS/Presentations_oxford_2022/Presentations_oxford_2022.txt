MUNA BASHYAL		16 shrawan 2081


			You have been tasked with designing a 
			database for the  Census department to 
			store all of their data, past and future. 
			
			The database must conform to these 
			constraints:
			
				1. There has been a census every 10 years.
				The year of each census is unique to that
				census. There are also some notes as well
				as the total population of the India.
			
				2. Each state has a unique name, and a value 
				for its square area. Every state participates
				individually in every census, providing 
				its population.
			
				3. Every person has a unique SSN, as well as 
				a name and birthday. Each person participates 
				in every census by providing their age.
			
				4. An address has a unique identifier,
				as well as a street name, city, state,
				and zipcode.
			
				5. A person lives at only one address.
			
			(a) Draw an ER diagram for this database. Be sure
			to mark the multiplicity of each 
			relationship (1-1, 1-many, many-many, etc) of the 
			diagram. Decide the key attributes and identify 
			them on the diagram by underlining them. 
			State all assumptions you make.
			
			(b) Translate your ER diagram into a relational schema. 
			Select approaches that yield the fewest number of
			relations; merge relations where appropriate. Specify
			the key of each relation in your schema. If the names 
			of your foreign keys do not match the primary key
			name, please state the link in your assumptions.














NAMITA THAPA MAGAR		16 shrawan 2081




				Consider the following relational database
					Employee (employee-name, street, city) 
					Works (employee-Name, company-name, salary)
					Company (company-name, city)
					Manages (employee-name, manager-name)
				
				(i) find the company that has the most employees.
				
				(ii) find all employees in the database who live 
				in the same city as the companies they work for.
				
				(iii) find the names of all employees who work 
				for first corporation bank.
				
				(iv) find all the employees who don’t work 
				for first corporation bank.
				
				(v) find all those employees who work for 
				first corporation bank and earn more than ` 10,000.
				
				For the above queries give an expression in SQL. 













NITESH ARYAL			17 shrawan 2081			BIM 2022



﻿				Draw an ER diagrams for the following scenario.
				Make any assumption if necessary.
				
				A university has a many Departments. Each departments
				have multiple teachers and one among them is head 
				of department. Each department offers multiple courses, 
				each being taught by a single teacher. 
				Therefore, one teacher belongs to only one department.
				Further, A student may enroll for many courses
				offered by different departments. 
				A particular course can be offered by only
				one department.
