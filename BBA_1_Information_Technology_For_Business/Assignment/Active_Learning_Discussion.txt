What is Active Learning
------------------------------
    Encourages students to engage actively in the learning process through 
    activities like group work, debates, or hands-on exercises, rather than
    passively listening.

                Identifies the hardware specifications needed for the new computer.
            
            
            
            Sita (Software Analyst):
                Explains the types of software (system software like 
                operating systems, and application software like
                productivity tools).
            
                Evaluates the compatibility of 
                hardware with different software solutions.

                collaboration, and prepares the final presentation.
                
                Encourages debates on conflicting ideas to arrive at 
                the best solutions.
            






Activity Plan
--------------------
      1. Group Research and Discussion
          Task: Each student researches their area and shares findings in a group discussion.
          Goal: Build a foundational understanding of computer hardware and software.
          Outcome: A shared document summarizing the team's insights.
          
      
      2. Debates
          Topic 1: "Which is more important for a computer’s performance: Hardware or Software?"
          Topic 2: "Should the focus be on creating specialized software for 
                    existing hardware or upgrading hardware to support advanced software?"

                  Task: Evaluate the pros and cons of each option and present recommendations.
      
      
      
      
      4. Creative Presentation
            Task: Design a visual presentation showcasing:
                  The relationship between hardware and software.
                  The group's recommendations for Techify’s product.
            
            Format: Infographics, flowcharts, or even a short skit to illustrate the concepts.
      
      
      5. Reflection and Feedback
            Activity: Each student reflects on:
                What they learned about hardware and software.
                How collaboration and debates helped refine their understanding.
            
            Outcome: Peer feedback on contributions and insights gained.


Expected Outcomes
      A comprehensive understanding of computer hardware and software.
      Enhanced teamwork, critical thinking, and presentation skills.
      Meaningful insights into how technology meets user needs.
