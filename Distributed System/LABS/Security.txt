Setup Environment
----------------------------
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or any version you're comfortable with)

Tools:
------
    OpenSSL for encryption/decryption tasks.
    iptables for firewall and network security rules.
    Wireshark for network traffic analysis.
    SELinux or AppArmor for Mandatory Access Control.
    A web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to demonstrate 
        availability and other security concepts.




LABS
-------
Confidentiality (Encryption)
Integrity (Hashing Files)
Availability (DDoS Simulation & Mitigation)
Authorization (User Permissions)
Fabrication (Creating Fake Logs)
Modification (File Tampering Detection)
Interception (Network Traffic Analysis)
Interruption (Service Disruption)



Confidentiality
---------------------
Meaning: Protecting information from unauthorized
access to ensure privacy.

Example: A sensitive document is encrypted with 
AES-256 before being emailed. Only the recipient 
with the decryption key can read it, maintaining
its confidentiality.





Integrity
--------------
Meaning: Ensuring that data remains accurate 
and unaltered during storage or transmission.


Example: A file is hashed using SHA-256, and
the hash is stored. Later, the file's hash is 
recalculated to check if it has been altered. 
If the hashes don't match, the file's 
integrity has been compromised.




Availability
---------------
Meaning: Ensuring that information and resources
are accessible when needed.

Example: A web server uses iptables to prevent
a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, ensuring the
website remains available to users.







Authorization
----------------
Meaning: Granting permissions to users to access 
certain resources based on their identity.


Example: Only members of the developers group
have write access to the /srv/development
directory, while others can only read.







Fabrication
----------------
Meaning: The unauthorized creation of data or 
activity, often to deceive or disrupt.


Example: A malicious user manually adds fake 
log entries to /var/log/syslog to cover their 
tracks or create confusion.





Modification
-----------------
Meaning: Unauthorized changes to data or systems.


Example: A file is altered without permission. 
A tool like AIDE detects the modification and 
alerts the system administrator.





Interception
---------------
Meaning: Unauthorized access to data during its 
transmission.


Example: Using Wireshark to capture unencrypted 
network traffic, allowing the attacker to read 
sensitive information like passwords.






Interruption
------------------
Meaning: Disruption of services or access to 
information, making it unavailable.


Example: A web server is deliberately shut
down by an attacker, causing a service outage.
Monitoring tools detect the interruption, and 
the service is quickly restored.

64 bytes from 172.30.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=60 time=0.638 ms




Sender Side (Encrypting the File)
-----------------------------------

1. Create a Sensitive File:
-----------------------
Create a file containing sensitive information.

controlplane $ echo "This is a confidential document. please
open by valid person only" > file.txt


controlplane $ cat file.txt 
This is a confidential document. please open by valid person only






2. Encrypt the File:
-----------------------
Use openssl to encrypt the file with AES-256.

The command will prompt for a password. This 
password will be required to decrypt the file
on the receiver's side.


controlplane $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.txt -out file.enc
enter aes-256-cbc encryption password: apple
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password: apple






controlplane $ cat file.txt 
This is a confidential document. please open by valid person only


controlplane $ cat file.enc 
Salted__Ʈ?JW|yӝ;e\CF|C j3崉er;d13}TWJ% nBA_7a;{}]ūڝ{mOg










3. Send the Encrypted File to the Receiver:
------------------------------------------------
Transfer the encrypted file (confidential.enc) to the receiver via a secure method (e.g., SCP, SFTP, or email).
Example using SCP:

scp file.enc user@receiver_ip:/path/to/destination/

controlplane $ scp file.enc root@172.30.2.2:/root                
file.enc                                           100%   96   149.2KB/s   00:00    









Decrypting the File on the Receiver's Side
--------------------------------------------


1. Receive the Encrypted File:
--------------------------------
The receiver gets the file file.enc 
from the sender.



2. Decrypt the File:
----------------
The receiver decrypts the file
using the same password provided
by the sender.

node01 $ whoami 
root

node01 $ pwd
/root

node01 $ ls
file.enc


node01 $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file.enc -out file_decrypted.txtfile_decrypted.txt
enter aes-256-cbc decryption password: apple



node01 $ cat file_decrypted.txt 
This is a confidential document. please open by valid person only


After entering the correct password, the receiver
will have access to the original text
in file_decrypted.txt.




Summary:
-----------
Sender: Encrypts the file/text using openssl 
and sends the encrypted content.


Receiver: Decrypts the file/text using the 
same password to access the original content.













echo "This is a confidential message." > message.txt
