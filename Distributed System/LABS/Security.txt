Setup Environment
----------------------------
OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or any version you're comfortable with)

Tools:
------
    OpenSSL for encryption/decryption tasks.
    iptables for firewall and network security rules.
    Wireshark for network traffic analysis.
    SELinux or AppArmor for Mandatory Access Control.
    A web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) to demonstrate 
        availability and other security concepts.




LABS
-------
Confidentiality (Encryption)
Integrity (Hashing Files)
Availability (DDoS Simulation & Mitigation)
Authorization (User Permissions)
Fabrication (Creating Fake Logs)
Modification (File Tampering Detection)
Interception (Network Traffic Analysis)
Interruption (Service Disruption)



Confidentiality
---------------------
Meaning: Protecting information from unauthorized
access to ensure privacy.

Example: A sensitive document is encrypted with 
AES-256 before being emailed. Only the recipient 
with the decryption key can read it, maintaining
its confidentiality.





Integrity
--------------
Meaning: Ensuring that data remains accurate 
and unaltered during storage or transmission.


Example: A file is hashed using SHA-256, and
the hash is stored. Later, the file's hash is 
recalculated to check if it has been altered. 
If the hashes don't match, the file's 
integrity has been compromised.




Availability
---------------
Meaning: Ensuring that information and resources
are accessible when needed.

Example: A web server uses iptables to prevent
a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, ensuring the
website remains available to users.







Authorization
----------------
Meaning: Granting permissions to users to access 
certain resources based on their identity.


Example: Only members of the developers group
have write access to the /srv/development
directory, while others can only read.







Fabrication
----------------
Meaning: The unauthorized creation of data or 
activity, often to deceive or disrupt.


Example: A malicious user manually adds fake 
log entries to /var/log/syslog to cover their 
tracks or create confusion.





Modification
-----------------
Meaning: Unauthorized changes to data or systems.


Example: A file is altered without permission. 
A tool like AIDE detects the modification and 
alerts the system administrator.





Interception
---------------
Meaning: Unauthorized access to data during its 
transmission.


Example: Using Wireshark to capture unencrypted 
network traffic, allowing the attacker to read 
sensitive information like passwords.






Interruption
------------------
Meaning: Disruption of services or access to 
information, making it unavailable.


Example: A web server is deliberately shut
down by an attacker, causing a service outage.
Monitoring tools detect the interruption, and 
the service is quickly restored.
