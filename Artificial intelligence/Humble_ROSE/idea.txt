SYNOPSIS FOR A RESEARCH ARTICLE
................................................................................

TITLE (Tentative):
................................................................................
A Structured Approach to Developing a High-Quality Review Article in ICT
................................................................................

1. INTRODUCTION
................................................................................
The growth of information and communication technology (ICT) research has resulted
in a large body of literature. Researchers now face challenges in identifying
reliable sources, synthesizing findings, analyzing gaps, and presenting meaningful
conclusions. Writing a review article requires systematic topic selection,
literature screening, critical evaluation, and evidence-based reasoning.
This synopsis outlines a structured approach to developing a high-quality review
article using established research methodology principles.

................................................................................

2. OBJECTIVES
................................................................................
- To identify a suitable research domain and formulate a meaningful review topic.
- To demonstrate systematic methods for collecting, screening, and analyzing
  existing literature.
- To present techniques for organizing research components logically.
- To describe methods for converting data into evidence.
- To outline best practices in academic writing, referencing, and avoiding
  plagiarism.
- To provide guidelines for discussion, conclusion, and future research writing.

................................................................................

3. BACKGROUND / THEORETICAL FOUNDATION
................................................................................
This synopsis is based on standard research methodology concepts such as:
- Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods approaches.
- Logical structuring and academic argument development.
- Systematic and narrative review principles.
- Evaluation and appraisal of research articles.
- Writing clarity, structure, and citation ethics.

Key references underlying these ideas include works on research design,
methodology, academic writing style, and literature analysis.

................................................................................

4. METHODOLOGY
................................................................................

4.1 Literature Identification
- Use keywords relevant to ICT.
- Search digital libraries and databases.
- Apply Boolean operators and inclusion/exclusion criteria.
- Focus on peer-reviewed and credible publications.

4.2 Literature Screening and Appraisal
- Evaluate each article’s methodology, reliability, and relevance.
- Categorize papers according to themes, domains, approaches, or datasets.

4.3 Thematic Synthesis
- Group findings into conceptual clusters.
- Identify similarities, differences, trends, and contradictions.

4.4 Evidence Construction
- Compare reported results and validation metrics.
- Analyze strengths, weaknesses, limitations, and contributions.

4.5 Gap Analysis and Critical Review
- Identify unexplored areas, methodological shortcomings, and research
  opportunities.
- Highlight areas requiring further investigation.

................................................................................

5. EXPECTED OUTPUT / ARTICLE STRUCTURE
................................................................................
The final article will follow this structure:
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Background and Definitions
- Review Methodology
- Thematic Analysis of Literature
- Discussion and Critical Evaluation
- Research Gaps Identified
- Future Directions
- Conclusion
- References (APA/IEEE)
