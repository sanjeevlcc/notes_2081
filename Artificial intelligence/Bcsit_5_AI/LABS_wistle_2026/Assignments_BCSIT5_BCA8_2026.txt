Q1. (History of AI) The history of Artificial Intelligence is marked by significant milestones.
    (a) Who is considered the "Father of Artificial Intelligence," and at which
          event in 1956 was the term officially coined? 
    (b) Briefly explain the concept of an "AI Winter." What were the main 
          causes of the First AI Winter (1974–1980)? 

Q2. (Turing Test - Theory) Alan Turing proposed the "Imitation Game" to replace the abstract 
    question "Can machines think?".
        (a) Draw a block diagram showing the arrangement of the three 
            participants (Interrogator, Human Respondent, Machine) in 
            the Turing Test. 
        (b) What is the specific "rule" or condition required for
            a machine to pass this test? 

Q3. (Turing Test - Numerical/Case Study) Refer to the table 
    of "Modern AI Milestones" and "Turing Test Examples" in your text:
        (a) The chatbot Eugene Goostman (2014) claimed to
            have fooled a certain percentage of judges to "pass" a
            version of the Turing Test. What was this percentage? 
        
        (b) In a hypothetical Turing Test scenario, if an
            interrogator asks 10 questions to both a human and
            a machine, and the machine provides answers that are
            indistinguishable from the human in 9 out of 10 instances,
            has the machine demonstrated "Acting Humanly"? Justify 
            your answer based on the definition of the Turing
            Test approach. 


Q4. (Scope of AI) Artificial Intelligence covers various domains. Match
    the following AI applications to their correct scope (Computer Vision,
    NLP, or Robotics): 
        (a) Generating a summary of a news article (e.g., ChatGPT).
        (b) A drone identifying diseased crops from aerial photos.
        (c) An industrial arm assembling car parts.

Q5. (AI Perspectives) AI can be defined through four different
    perspectives. Distinguish between "Thinking Humanly" and
    "Thinking Rationally".

      Which of these two approaches relies on "Laws of Thought" and
      logic, and which one relies on modeling the biological processes 
      of the human brain?

        (a) Define the term "Rational Agent". 
        (b) Using the PEAS model, list one example for 
            each of the following components for the self-driving car: 
                      Performance Measure
                      Environment
                      Actuators
                      Sensors

Q7. (Game Playing - Theory) In the context of AI Game Playing:

    (a) Which famous AI system used massive parallel processing to defeat
          Garry Kasparov in 1997? 
    (b) Briefly explain the purpose of Alpha-Beta Pruning. How does
          it help the Minimax algorithm in decision making?

Q1. Consider the Route Planning map provided in the text (Page 44) where
an agent needs to travel from an initial state to a goal state.

      What is the path cost if the agent travels from Butwal to 
      Bhairahawa and then to Bethari, given the distances are 27 km 
      and 24 km respectively?.
                
      Why would an A Search* algorithm potentially choose a 
      different path compared to a simple "Greedy" search in 
      this network? Calculate the total cost g(n) for the
      path Butwal -> Kalavani -> Bethari (using distances 24 km + 20 km) 
      to support your reasoning..




Q2. You are analyzing an 8-Puzzle Problem as described in
the case study (Page 43). The Initial State has tiles arranged
as [1, 4, 2; 7, 5, 3; 8, 6, Empty] and the Goal State is [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, Empty].

      What is the value of the heuristic function h(n) for 
      the Initial State if we define h(n) as the "number 
      of misplaced tiles"? (Do not count the empty space). 
      
      Why is using a heuristic like "misplaced tiles"
      or "Manhattan distance" necessary for solving complex 
      puzzles efficiently compared to blind search?.


Q3. In a Game Playing scenario (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess), consider a 
simple game tree where the Utility Function assigns values
of +1 (Win), -1 (Loss), and 0 (Draw) to the terminal states.

        What would be the value propagated up to the root node if
        the current player is a "Maximizer" and their available moves
        lead to three states with backed-up values of -1, 0, and +1 respectively?.        
        
        Why does the Minimax algorithm assume the opponent plays
        optimally (choosing the minimum value) when calculating this utility?.



Q4. Refer to the SmartFarm AI case study (Page 2). The system 
detects "Early Blight" with 95% confidence based on visual patterns.

        What is the logical implication derived by the system if the
        rule is: IF leaf has dark circular spots AND yellow edges THEN
        disease = Early Blight? If the system analyzes 1000 images and 
        correctly identifies 950 of them, calculate the error rate..
        
        Why might the system fail (give a wrong numerical prediction) if
        shown a leaf type, such as a banana leaf, that was not included in
        its training data of thousands of images?.


Q5. A Self-Driving Car agent calculates a "Performance Measure" based
on safety and speed. Suppose the formula is Score=(100×Safety)−(2×Time).

        What is the final score if the car completes a trip with a 
        Safety rating of 0.9 (on a scale of 0-1) and takes 30 minutes?
        
        Why must the agent prioritize the "Safety" variable heavily 
        in this equation to be considered acting Rationally? (Refer to
        the rational agent stopping at a red light)..



Q6. In the context of search algorithms for the route problem (Page 42), assume
a straight-line distance (heuristic h) from Butwal to Belbas is 10 km.

        What is the value of the evaluation function f(n)=g(n)+h(n) for 
        the node Butwal, assuming we are just starting (g=0)?
        
        
        Why does Best-First Search rely heavily on this h(n) value
        compared to Uniform Cost Search which relies only on g(n)?.



Q7. Consider the Turing Test history. The chatbot Eugene Goostman (2014)
claimed to have fooled 33% of the judges.

        What is the specific numerical threshold (ratio or percentage) often
        cited in the original 1950 proposal or modern interpretations for a
        machine to "pass" the test (e.g., is 33% usually considered a full pass)?.
        
        Why is this percentage significantly lower than 100%, yet still
        considered a milestone in Artificial Intelligence history?.




Q8. A Medical Expert System (like MYCIN) uses certainty factors. If Symptom A 
implies Disease X with certainty 0.7, and Symptom B implies Disease X with certainty 0.5.
      
      What is the combined certainty if the system simply sums the
      evidences (assuming a simplified additive model capped at 1.0)?
      
      
      Why did early systems like MYCIN use these numerical "Certainty Factors" or
      probabilities instead of strict Boolean (True/False) logic?.


Q9. What are the four main AI Perspectives defined by Russell and
Norvig (Acting Humanly, Thinking Humanly, Acting Rationally, Thinking Rationally)?

        Why is the "Acting Rationally" perspective
        (Rational Agent approach) generally preferred in modern engineering 
        and science over the "Thinking Humanly" approach? .        
        
        Q10. What is the PEAS model (Performance, Environment, Actuators,
        Sensors) as applied to an intelligent agent?

        Why is it critical to fully define the Task Environment (as observable, 
        deterministic, etc.) before designing the agent's program? Use the
        Self-Driving Car example to explain.

Q1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): The "Fruit Classification" Problem

Scenario: 
    You are building a simple robotic sorter for a grocery store. 
    The robot classifies fruit into two categories: Apples (Class A)
    and Oranges (Class B) based on two features: Weight (grams)
    and Texture Score (1-10 scale).

    You have the following training data:
            P1: (150g, 4) → Apple
            P2: (170g, 6) → Apple
            P3: (140g, 3) → Apple
            P4: (130g, 9) → Orange
            P5: (160g, 8) → Orange

 Numerical Question: 
      A new unknown fruit arrives with features Pnew =(160g,5).
        1. Calculate the Euclidean Distance between Pnew and
            all 5 training points.
        
        2. Classify the new fruit using K=3. Show which 
            neighbors are selected and the final majority vote.
    
    
 Theoretical Logic:
          Why is scaling important? If you used the raw numbers above, 
          the "Weight" (ranging 130-170) dominates the distance 
          calculation compared to "Texture" (ranging 3-9). How
          would this bias the classifier, and how do you fix it?
          
          Effect of K: What would happen if you chose K=1 versus K=5 
          in this specific scenario? Which one is more prone to noise?





Q2. Linear Regression: Predicting House Prices
Scenario: 
    A real estate agency wants a basic ML model to predict 
    house prices based on the number of bedrooms. They have 
    a tiny dataset for testing the logic of Simple Linear 
    Regression (y=mx+c).

Data:
    x (Bedrooms): 1, 2, 3
    y (Price in $100k): 2, 4, 5

      Numerical Question:
      
            Calculate the Slope (m) and Intercept (c) using
            the Least Squares Method formulas
                 (Hint: First calculate ∑x,∑y,∑xy,∑x^2).
            
            Using your equation, predict the price of a 
            house with 4 bedrooms.
      
      
      
      Theoretical Logic:
          The Loss Function: Explain the concept of Mean Squared 
          Error (MSE). Why do we square the difference between the 
          predicted value and the actual value ( (y pred −yactual)^2
          instead of just taking the absolute difference?





Q3. Decision Trees: The "Play Tennis" Entropy Calculation

Scenario: 
      You are analyzing weather data to determine if a tennis match
      should be held. You are at the very root of the Decision Tree
      and need to decide which attribute to split on.

    Current Dataset (Root Node):
          Total Days: 10
          Play Tennis = Yes: 6 days
          Play Tennis = No: 4 days
    
    You are considering splitting on the feature "Humidity":
        High Humidity: 5 days (1 Yes, 4 No)
        Normal Humidity: 5 days (5 Yes, 0 No)

  Numerical Question:
        Calculate the Entropy of the Root Node.
        
        Calculate the Information Gain if we split by "Humidity". 
        (Hint: Calculate weighted entropy of the children nodes and
        subtract from root entropy).
  
  Theoretical Logic:
        Pruning: If we built a tree that perfectly classified every
        single day in historical data (0 error), why might that be a
        bad model for future predictions? Explain Overfitting in the
        context of Decision Trees.





Q4. K-Means Clustering: Customer Segmentation
Scenario: 
    A bank wants to group customers into 2 clusters (K=2) based 
    on "Loan Amount" and "Credit Score". We start with the 
    following 4 customers:

          A: (2, 10)
          B: (2, 5)
          C: (8, 4)
          D: (5, 8)


Numerical Question: Assume we randomly initialize two Centroids:
        Centroid 1 (C1): (2, 10) [Same as Point A]
        Centroid 2 (C2): (5, 8) [Same as Point D]

        Perform Iteration 1:
              Cluster Assignment: Calculate the distance of 
              Points B and C from both C1 and C2. Assign them
              to the nearest centroid.
              
              Update Centroids: Calculate the new coordinates
              of C1 and C2 based on the points assigned to them.



      Theoretical Logic:
            Convergence: How does the algorithm know when to stop?
            
            Elbow Method: Since K-means requires you to pick K 
            beforehand, how would you use the "Elbow Method" graph
            to determine the optimal number of clusters?
      




Q5. Genetic Algorithms: Optimizing a Binary String
Scenario: 
      We want to maximize a fitness function f(x)=x^2, where x is 
      an integer represented by a 4-bit binary 
      string (e.g., 0101=5,5^2 =25).

          Initial Population:
              S1: 0110 (6)
              S2: 1000 (8)
              S3: 0011 (3)
              S4: 1100 (12)


    
    Numerical Question:
    
          Selection: Calculate the fitness (x^2) for all four
          strings. Which two parents have the highest 
          probability of being selected?
          
          Crossover: Perform a Single-Point Crossover on the
          two best parents at Crossover Point = 2 (between 
          the 2nd and 3rd bit). Write the two new Offspring strings.
          
          Mutation: Take the first offspring from step 2 and
          flip the last bit (Mutation). What is the new 
          integer value?
    
    
    
    Theoretical Logic:
    
              Role of Mutation: If we only used Selection and Crossover, 
              the algorithm might get stuck in a "Local Maximum." How 
              does Mutation prevent this?







Q6. Case Study:
Neural Networks (The "MediScan" Diagnosis)


"MediScan AI" is a new medical startup attempting to revolutionize 
the early detection of Diabetes using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).
Traditionally, doctors look at Glucose levels and Insulin levels 
manually. MediScan aims to automate this.


They have designed a simple Perceptron (a single-layer neural network) 
to act as a binary classifier (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Healthy). The network
takes two normalized inputs:
        x1 : Glucose Level (scaled 0-1)
        x2 : Insulin Level (scaled 0-1)


The network has two associated weights (w1,w2) and a 
bias (b). The output determines the diagnosis based
on an Activation Function.


During the testing phase, a specific patient,
"Patient X," has the following readings:
        Glucose (x1) = 0.8
        Insulin (x2) = 0.5

The current weights of the model after 100 epochs of training are:
          w1 =4.0
          w2 =−2.0
          Bias b=−1.0

The startup is currently debating which Activation Function 
to use: the Step Function or the Sigmoid Function. The Step
function outputs 1 if the input is positive, 0 otherwise. 
The Sigmoid function provides a probability between 0 and 1. 
Management is concerned that the model is strictly linear 
and might fail to capture complex relationships, leading 
to a discussion about "Deep Learning" and "Hidden Layers."




Questions based on the Case:
----------------------------------
    A. Numerical Calculation (The Forward Pass):
    
          1. Calculate the Weighted Sum (z) for Patient X using the formula:
          z=(x1 . w1)  +  (x2 . w2) + b
          
          2. Diagnosis:
              If the network uses a Step Function (Output = 1 if z≥0, else 0), 
              is Patient X diagnosed as Diabetic?
          
              If the network uses the Sigmoid Function (σ(z)= (1 / (1+e^−z) , what
              is the probability that Patient X is diabetic?
              (Use e^−1.2 ≈0.3 and e^1.2≈3.3).
    
    
    B. Theoretical Analysis:
    
          1.The Learning Process: Explain how the Backpropagation 
            algorithm would update the weights (w1 ,w2) if the actual
            label for Patient X was "1" (Diabetic) but the model 
            predicted a low probability. Mention the role of 
            the "Learning Rate."
      
          2. Limitations: The management is worried the model 
              is "linear". Why can a single Perceptron NOT solve a
              problem like XOR (Exclusive OR)? How does adding a Hidden
              Layer solve this issue?
