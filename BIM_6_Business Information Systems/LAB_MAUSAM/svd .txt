Case Question (Real-World Framing)
----------------------------------------------
Can we use symptom data (Fever, Cough, Fatigue) to understand the
latent structure among patients and diagnoses using SVD? Could
this help cluster or relate patients based on common patterns for 
  decision support in diagnostics?

Matrix Construction (Data Matrix)
  --------------------------------
We remove the categorical "Diagnosis" temporarily and build a numerical matrix:

Let this be matrix A, size 5 Ã— 3 (patients Ã— symptoms).


  
| Patient | Fever | Cough | Fatigue |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| P1      | 3     | 7     | 4       |
| P2      | 6     | 2     | 8       |
| P3      | 1     | 9     | 5       |
| P4      | 8     | 4     | 3       |
| P5      | 5     | 6     | 7       |





SVD Overview
  -------------
SVD decomposes matrix A as:

      A=U  Î£  V 
      
          Where:
              U = Patient relationships (5Ã—3)
              Î£ = Diagonal matrix with singular values (3Ã—3)
              Váµ€ = Symptom relationships (3Ã—3)
              
              



Python Code (SVD Execution)
---------------------------------

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from numpy.linalg import svd

# Step 1: Create matrix
A = np.array([
    [3, 7, 4],
    [6, 2, 8],
    [1, 9, 5],
    [8, 4, 3],
    [5, 6, 7]
])

# Step 2: Apply SVD
U, S, VT = svd(A)

# Convert singular values to diagonal matrix
S_matrix = np.zeros((5, 3))
S_matrix[:3, :3] = np.diag(S)

# Print components
print("U (Patient latent features):\n", U)
print("\nÎ£ (Singular Values):\n", S)
print("\nVáµ€ (Symptom latent features):\n", VT)

# Optional: Reconstruct to check
A_reconstructed = U @ S_matrix @ VT
print("\nReconstructed A:\n", np.round(A_reconstructed, 2))








Interpretation of SVD Results
  -----------------------------------


ðŸ”¹ Singular Values Î£
Large singular values imply dominant latent patterns.

If S = [18.84, 5.03, 1.44] (example), most of the data variance is 
  explained by the first 1â€“2 components.


  
ðŸ”¹ Váµ€ â€“ Symptom Patterns
Each row (of Váµ€) shows a latent dimension:

Row 1 might show that "Fatigue + Fever" is a strong diagnostic signal.

Row 2 could show contrasting relationships between "Cough vs Fever".




  
ðŸ”¹ U â€“ Patient Loadings
Rows of U show how much each patient aligns with latent features:

If P1 and P3 project similarly, they may belong to similar diagnostic
  clusters (e.g., both have Asthma).

P2 and P5 may cluster if their values in U are close â†’ likely Malaria.




  
âœ…  Case Insights and Use
  -----------------------------
ðŸŽ¯ Diagnosis Clustering:
Patients with similar rows in U share latent
  symptom patterns â†’ could belong to same disease.

Helps reduce dimensionality, visualize patient clusters, or 
  assist ML-based prediction.


  
ðŸŽ¯ Feature Understanding:
High values in rows of Váµ€ highlight which symptoms are most 
  influential in explaining variability.

E.g., if fatigue dominates a component â†’ it's crucial for diagnosis differentiation.




  
âœ… Conclusion
SVD reveals hidden symptom patterns among patients. It shows that:

Patients can be grouped based on symptom intensity and variation.

Symptoms like Fever and Fatigue often co-occur in latent dimensions.

The decomposition helps us reduce dimensional complexity and could 
  guide clinical decision support tools or symptom clustering for diagnosis.
