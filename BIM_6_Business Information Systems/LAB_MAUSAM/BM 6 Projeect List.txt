1. Customer Churn Prediction System

Short Description:
A machine learning-based system that predicts the likelihood of 
customers leaving a service (churn) by analyzing their behavior, 
purchase history, and engagement metrics, helping businesses take 
proactive retention measures.


Abstract:
This project uses historical customer
data (e.g., transaction frequency, support interactions) to 
predict churn risk. Admins can add, update, or delete customer
records via a CRUD-enabled SQL database. The system employs Logistic 
Regression, Random Forest, or ANN to classify customers into 
"high-risk" or "low-risk" categories. A dashboard visualizes 
insights, allowing businesses to offer targeted discounts or 
interventions. The backend is built with Flask/Django, while the
frontend uses React/Streamlit for real-time monitoring. 
Deployable via Docker/AWS, this tool helps reduce customer attrition
in subscription-based services.
