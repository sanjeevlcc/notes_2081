                              CASE
                            ---------
Six Sigma case scenario for iPhone production, let's
assume the production of 1 million (10 lakh) 
iPhone 15 units in 2024. 


            
            
            We will calculate the number of defective pieces for different 
            Sigma levels (3, 4, 5, and 6 Sigma), 
            analyze standard deviation (SD), 
            mean, 
            variance,
            and create relevant visualizations 
            such as a normal distribution graph and 
            sigma-level graphs using Python.
            
            
            
            Here is the breakdown for each sigma level:
            
            Six Sigma: 3.4 defects per million units (DPMO).
            Five Sigma: 233 defects per million units.
            Four Sigma: 6,210 defects per million units.
            Three Sigma: 66,807 defects per million units.
            



Python Code

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Total production
total_production = 1000000

# Defects per million for different sigma levels
defects_per_million = {
    '3 Sigma': 66807,  # 3 defects per 1000 units
    '4 Sigma': 6210,   # 4 defects per 1000 units
    '5 Sigma': 233,    # 5 defects per 1000 units
    '6 Sigma': 3.4     # 6 defects per 1000 units
}

# Calculate the number of defective pieces for each sigma level

sd = 3.4  # Standard deviation corresponding to 6 Sigma
x = np.linspace(-4 * sd, 4 * sd, 1000)  # Creating a range for the x-axis
y = (1/(sd * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi))) * np.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mean)/sd)**2)  # Normal distribution formula

# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.xlabel('Defective Pieces (Deviation from Mean)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Probability Density', fontsize=12)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Now let's plot a graph for defects at different sigma levels

# Sigma level vs defective pieces
sigma_levels = ['3 Sigma', '4 Sigma', '5 Sigma', '6 Sigma']
defective_counts = list(defective_pieces.values())

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

print(f"Mean Defective Pieces: {mean_defects}")
print(f"Variance of Defective Pieces: {variance_defects}")
print(f"Standard Deviation of Defective Pieces: {std_dev_defects}")


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            3 Sigma: 66807 defective pieces
            4 Sigma: 6210 defective pieces
            5 Sigma: 233 defective pieces
            6 Sigma: 3 defective pieces





          Mean Defective Pieces: 18313.25
          Variance of Defective Pieces: 790073286.1875
          Standard Deviation of Defective Pieces: 28108.242317645905




Explanation:
------------
    Defective Pieces Calculation:
        We calculate the number of defective pieces
        based on the defects per million for each sigma level.
    
    
    Normal Distribution Graph: 
        For the 6 Sigma case, 
        we assume a mean of zero and a standard deviation corresponding 
        to the 6 Sigma defect rate. A normal distribution graph is generated 
        to show the defect distribution.
        
    
    Bar Plot for Defective Pieces: 
        This shows the number of defective pieces at each sigma level.
    
    
    Statistics (Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation): 
        These are calculated and printed to give insights into the 
        distribution of defective pieces.
    


Expected Output:
------------------
Defective pieces for each sigma level (3 Sigma, 4 Sigma, 5 Sigma, and 6 Sigma).

A graph showing the normal distribution for the 6 Sigma case.

A bar graph comparing the number of defective pieces at different sigma levels.

Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation of defective pieces across the sigma levels.
