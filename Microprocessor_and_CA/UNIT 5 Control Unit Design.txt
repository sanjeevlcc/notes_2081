===============================================================
5.1 Control of the processor
===============================================================

The control unit (CU) is a fundamental component of the 
central processing unit (CPU). 

Its primary role is to direct the operations of the processor, 
ensuring that instructions are executed correctly and efficiently. 

The control unit orchestrates the activities of the CPU by 
managing the flow of data between the CPU, memory, 
and input/output devices.



Key Functions of the Control Unit:
------------------------------------
        Instruction Fetching: 
        ---------------------
                The control unit retrieves instructions from memory. 
                This process involves placing the address of the instruction 
                on the address bus, and reading the instruction from memory
                into the instruction register.
        
        
        Instruction Decoding:
        ---------------------
                The control unit interprets the fetched instruction
                to determine the required operations. 
                This typically involves breaking down the instruction 
                into opcode and operands.
        
        
        Execution Control:
        ---------------------
                The control unit generates the necessary control 
                signals to execute the instruction. 
                These signals direct the ALU, registers, and other
                components to perform specific operations.
        
        
        Data Transfer:
        ---------------------
                The control unit manages data transfer within
                the CPU, between the CPU and memory, and between the
                CPU and I/O devices. 
                This includes operations like reading from or writing to memory.
        
        
        Control Signal Generation:
        -----------------------------
                Based on the decoded instruction, the control unit 
                generates a sequence of control signals that 
                orchestrate the execution of the instruction.


Example:
        Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle: This is the basic operational 
        process of the CPU. 
        
        The control unit fetches an instruction from memory, decodes 
        it to understand what action is required, and then executes 
        the instruction by generating the appropriate control signals.






===============================================================
5.2 Hardwired Control Unit(Control unit inputs and logic)
===============================================================

A hardwired control unit is a type of control unit where
the control signals are generated by fixed hardware
circuits without using any programmable memory. 

This approach involves using combinational logic 
circuits to produce the control signals required 
for instruction execution.

Key Components:
------------------
        Instruction Register (IR):
        ------------------
                Holds the current instruction being executed. 
                The opcode part of the instruction is used 
                to generate control signals.
        
        Decoder: 
        ------------------
                Converts the opcode from the instruction 
                register into a set of control signals.
                The decoder's output determines the 
                operations to be performed.
        
        
        Control Logic Gates: 
        ------------------
                Use combinational logic to generate specific 
                control signals based on the current state and 
                inputs from the instruction register.



Operation:
----------
        Fetch: 
        --------
                The control unit retrieves an instruction from 
                memory and places it in the instruction register.
        
        Decode: 
        -------
                The opcode is sent to the decoder, which 
                translates it into a set of control signals.
        
        Execute: 
        --------
                The control signals generated by the control
                logic gates direct the various parts of the CPU
                to perform the specified operations (e.g., reading from memory, 
                writing to a register, performing arithmetic operations).


Characteristics:
-----------------
        Speed:
        --------
                Hardwired control units are typically faster 
                than microprogrammed control units because
                the control signals are generated directly 
                by the hardware without any intermediate steps.
        
        Complexity:
        --------------
                Designing a hardwired control unit can be 
                complex, especially for CPUs with a large 
                and complex instruction set. Each instruction 
                requires a unique set of control signals, which
                must be carefully designed and optimized.


Example:
Simple RISC Processor: In a Reduced Instruction Set 
Computer (RISC) processor, the instruction set is small 
and simple, which makes it feasible to use a hardwired control unit.

The fixed logic circuits can quickly generate the control
signals needed for instruction execution, leading to high performance.
