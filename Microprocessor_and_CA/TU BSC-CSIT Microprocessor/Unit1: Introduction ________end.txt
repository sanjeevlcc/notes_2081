1. Introduction to Microprocessor
==============================================================================================


A microprocessor is an integrated circuit (IC) that serves as the central processing unit (CPU)
of a computer or digital device. It performs arithmetic, logic, and control operations specified 
by instructions stored in memory.



Key Features of a Microprocessor:
---------------------------------------
      Small size, high speed, and low power consumption compared to earlier CPUs.
      Programmable: Executes instructions stored in memory.
      General-purpose or special-purpose (e.g., for embedded systems).



Evolution of Microprocessors:
---------------------------------
      First Generation (1971-1973): 4-bit (Intel 4004)
      
      Second Generation (1974-1978): 8-bit (Intel 8085, Motorola 6800)
      
      Third Generation (1979-1995): 16-bit & 32-bit (Intel 8086, 80386)
      
      Fourth Generation (1995-Present): 64-bit (Pentium, Core i-series, AMD Ryzen)







===========================================================================================
2. Components of a Microprocessor
==============================================================================================


A microprocessor consists of three major components:

(A) Registers
------------------
Small, high-speed memory locations inside the CPU used to store data temporarily.

Types:
---------
    General-Purpose Registers (GPRs):
        Store operands for ALU operations (e.g., A , B, C, D , E, H , L in 80850.
    
    Special-Purpose Registers:
        Program Counter (PC): Holds the address of the next instruction.
        Instruction Register (IR): Stores the current instruction being executed.
        Stack Pointer (SP): Points to the top of the stack in memory.
        Status/Flag Register: Contains condition flags (Zero, Carry, Sign, etc.).



(B) Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
--------------------------------------
        Performs arithmetic (+, –, ×, ÷) and logical (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) operations.
        
        Takes inputs from registers, processes them, and stores results back in registers.
        
        Flags (Condition Codes): Modified after ALU operations to indicate 
                                 results (e.g., Zero flag = 1 if result is zero).




(C) Control & Timing Unit
--------------------------------
      Manages instruction execution by generating control signals. eg IO/M', S0, S1, RD'. WR'
      
      Functions:
      
          Fetch: Retrieves instruction from memory.
      
          Decode: Interprets the instruction.
      
          Execute: Performs the operation using ALU.
      
      Uses a system clock to synchronize operations (measured in Hz, e.g., 2 GHz).





==============================================================================================
3. System Bus
==============================================================================================

The system bus is a collection of parallel communication lines that interconnect the major
components of a computer system (CPU, memory, and I/O devices). It serves as the highway
for data transfer between these components.



Key Characteristics:
-------------------------
        Parallel transmission (multiple bits transferred simultaneously)
        
        Shared communication path (components take turns using the bus)
        
        Determines system performance (bus speed affects overall speed)
        


Three Types of System Buses
------------------------------
(A) Data Bus
        Function: 
            Carries actual data/instructions between components
        
        Properties:        
            Bidirectional (data flows both to and from CPU)
            
            Width determines "word size" of processor (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, etc.)
        
            Example: 64-bit data bus can transfer 8 bytes at once



(B) Address Bus
        Function:
            Carries memory/I/O port addresses from CPU
        
        Properties:        
        Unidirectional (CPU → Memory/I/O only)
        
        Width determines maximum addressable memory
        
                  Formula: Max Memory = 2^(address bus width)
                  
                  Example: 32-bit address bus → 4GB addressable space
        
        Separate I/O address space in some architectures (e.g., x86)





(C) Control Bus
      Function:
            Carries timing and control signals
      
      Key Signals:
            Signal	        Purpose
            --------        -------------
            RD	            Read operation
            WR	            Write operation
            M/IO	          Memory vs. I/O selection
            READY	          Wait state control
            INTR	          Interrupt request
            RESET	          System reset



Bus Organization in a Microprocessor System
-----------------------------------------------
        CPU communicates with Memory (RAM/ROM) and I/O Devices via buses.
        
        Control signals manage data flow (e.g., READ, WRITE, RESET).
        
        Clock signal synchronizes operations.











==============================================================================================
4. Microprocessor Systems with Bus Organization
==============================================================================================

A microprocessor system consists of the CPU (Central Processing Unit), memory, and I/O devices, 
all interconnected via a system bus. The bus organization defines how these components communicate
and share data.




Key Components in a Bus-Based System
-------------------------------------------
      Microprocessor (CPU) – Executes instructions.
      
      Memory (RAM/ROM) – Stores programs and data.
      
      I/O Devices – Allow interaction (keyboard, display, sensors).
      
      System Bus – Facilitates communication between components.

Working Principle:
----------------------
      Fetch Cycle: CPU fetches instruction from memory via Address & Data Bus.
      
      Execute Cycle: ALU performs operation, results stored in registers/memory.
      
      I/O Operations: Data transferred between CPU and I/O devices using buses.
      
      





Bus Structure & Its Role
------------------------------------


The system bus is divided into three types:

1. Data Bus

        Purpose: Transfers data between CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
        
        Bidirectional (data can flow in both directions).
        
        Width determines processing capability:
        
                8-bit bus → Transfers 8 bits at a time.
                
                16-bit bus → Transfers 16 bits (e.g., Intel 8086).
                
                32/64-bit bus → Modern processors.


2. Address Bus

        Purpose: Carries memory/I/O addresses from CPU.
        
        Unidirectional (CPU sends addresses only).
        
        Width determines memory capacity:
        
        20-bit address bus (e.g., 8086) →  2^20 = = 1 MB addressable memory.

        64-bit address bus → Supports terabytes of memory.




3. Control Bus
        Purpose: Carries control signals for coordination.
        
        Signals include:
        
                Read (RD) – CPU reads from memory/I/O.
                
                Write (WR) – CPU writes to memory/I/O.
                
                Clock (CLK) – Synchronizes operations.
                
                Interrupt (INTR) – External device requests CPU attention.
                
                Reset (RST) – Reinitializes the CPU.
